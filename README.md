# Finsight Avatar Web

A Vite-powered React + TypeScript playground featuring a lightweight 3D guide that speaks using the Web Speech API.
The scene is rendered with `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, and `@react-three/drei`, while `zustand` handles speech
state.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the development server URL that Vite prints in your terminal to explore the avatar. You can type any text and let
Fin voice it through the browser's speech synthesis support.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server with hot module replacement.
- `npm run build` – run the TypeScript compiler and build a production bundle.
- `npm run preview` – serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – check the project with ESLint.
